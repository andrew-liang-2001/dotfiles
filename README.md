Currently a work in progress.
Ideally works across macOS and Fedora/Arch

Tools:
- dotfiles managed by chezmoi
- miniconda installed in ~
- vimrc file for ideavim
- neovim (customised from LazyVim)
- alacritty terminal
- zsh (recently migrated from prezto to zim to test it out)
  - Essential plugins:
    - prompt showing pwd and git information: sorin
    - syntax highlighting
    - enhanced vi mode
    - autocompletion
- bash which I almost never use
